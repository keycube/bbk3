# INTRODUCTION

The BBK3 (BabyCube) is the miniature derivative of the K3. Thanks to these 5 keys, its gyroscope and accelerator, you can control a multitude of applications thanks to its bluetooh connection.

# 3D Model

The 3D models were made with Fusion 360. The models have been tested with a resin printer but are intended for an FDM printer. (The colors are present to facilitate the 3D preview, you are free to choose when printing.)
